"""SQLite persistence for screening runs (explainability / audit trail).

Uses the standard-library ``sqlite3`` (no extra dependency). Each screening run
is stored as a row with its full JSON payload, so a run can be retrieved later
via ``GET /runs/{id}`` and recent runs can be listed. A fresh connection is
opened per operation, which keeps the store safe to call from FastAPI's worker
threads.
